Once you have logged you will see a page that allows you to choose a layout to select. 
Click a button and it will take you to a control panel for that railroad. 
If a railroad is equiped with a webcam the picture will display below the control array.
For the sake of example, some railroads will have a youtube video linked in instead of a webcam. 

To use the controls, first type in a locomotive number. 
Some locos I have are 4849, or 8973, or 1403.
Addresses are only 4 digits long

The faster and slower buttons change the speed by 5 increments, the silder also ajusts the speed.
The stop button will perform an emergency stop but the DCC emergency stop function does not set speed to 0. Be mindful of this as any change to a locomotive's direction or speed will cause it to take off at the previous speed it was traveling. Pulling the slider to 0 or clicking the slower button until the speed is listed as 0 will ensure a full stop. 

The horn button sounds the horn when it is held down. 

The toggle switches operate the headlight and functions 1 through 12. These are simply listed as F1-F12 as they are defined differently by different decoder(the recieving chip in the locomotive) manufacturers. This is something that the modeler is always required to commit to memory. 

I would like you to be able to experience the project in full with streaming and the ability to contorl the trains, however, due to the nature of out internet connection I am not able to leave the  system constatnly operational. If you send me an email at ennis@steelydev.com we can schedule a time when I can get a stream running and have a railroad operaitonal for you to try actually using the program on.
